HexMC was designed first and foremost for servers; from our inception, we designed this modpack for the PolyMC community server. Now we have grown past that point and expanded upon our core, opening opportunities to other servers and allowing you to play with your friends.
<br><br>
HexMC comes bundled with a list of featured servers that we highly recommend you explore. If you would like your server to be included, you can join our discord: https://discord.gg/KHgM3dQJGM
